I received my bachelor’s and master’s degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Dhaka. Beginning with a master’s thesis focusing on Glioblastoma, my research works to date include investigating different forms of brain tumors. Currently as a doctoral researcher, I am expanding my interest and knowledge in neuro-oncology. <br>
