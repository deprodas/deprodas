I received my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Dhaka. Beginning with a master’s thesis focusing on Glioblastoma, my research works to date include investigating different forms of brain tumors. Currently, I am expanding my interest and knowledge in neuro-oncology. My repositories contain project reproducibility scripts and functions developed for personal research use. <br>
