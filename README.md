I received my bachelor’s and master’s degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Dhaka. Beginning with a master’s thesis focusing on Glioblastoma, my research works to date include investigating different forms of brain tumours. Currently as a doctoral researcher, I am expanding my interest and knowledge in neuro-oncology. <br> 

My academic research works, including peer-reviewed publications, are updated on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Depro-Das) [<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/ORCID_iD.svg" alt="alt_text" width="20px">](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0969-0071) .
