I received my bachelor's degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Dhaka and currently enrolled in the Master’s program under the same department. My scientific interest can be verbalized in the words of Carl Sagan, who once said, *“Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.”*
